JSON Form
=========

The JSON Form library is a JavaScript client-side library that takes a
structured data model defined as a [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) as
input and returns a [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)-friendly
HTML form that matches the schema.

The layout of the generated HTML form may be fine-tuned and completed through
a simple declarative mechanism. The generated HTML form includes client-side
validation logic that provides direct inline feedback to the user upon form
submission.
